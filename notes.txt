- i think i could use 'for each' in some cases - maybe in case of checking that accordions work, generate btn works and etc
- i find it a bit weird to write function that toggles text in commands(discussed yesterday, sort of)
 because we can't see what was tested precisely as if it was with "it"
- i feel that input fields check can be optimized
- i should use common object more
- sometimes i have problem with variables for elements:
 i fail to select the right one so i used cy.get(smth).get(smth)
- it is hard-ish to understand what exactly needs to be tested and when is enough
